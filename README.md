WordPress - Global synced patterns

This is used to reference synced patterns from the master site to child sites in a WordPress network installation. 
This is useful if pages and products are syncronised from the master site to child sites. 
Normally in a child site the patterned id referenced will not be available in the child site and the block will not be displayed.

Ideally this should be a WordPress block, if anyone is interested in creating a block with this functionality, let me know?
